# Alien_invasion
**INTRODUCTION**

“Alien Invasion” is a computer game in which the user controls the rocket and fire bullets in response to the player input to destroy the fleets of Aliens approaching earth.
We’ll use Pygame, a collection of fun, powerful Python modules that manage graphics, animation, and even sound, making it easier to build sophisticated games.
This game is developed such a way that, as the player progress levels difficulty of the game increases as the new aliens move faster than the previous level.
# ABSTRACT
**ABSTRACT**

The player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player’s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
